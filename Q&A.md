# Questions about microspheres  
## Regarding the sensitivity of the microspheres  
* **Q.** Will agitation destroy the microspheres? Or Does air dry up the microspheres? And would that contribute to microsphere aggregation? What is the maximum viable time for which the microspheres remain physically and chemically intact?  
* **A.** Agitation while they're dry on powder or suspended in liquid? 
As part of the the fabrication process, the microspheres are suspended in water (100-200ml). Once we are done making them,the following procedure consists on a series of rinsing steps where the mixture of microspheres + water is centrifuged to form a pellet. The supernatant is then removed and the pellet is resuspended in dH2O, mixed by vortexing and centrifuged again. This steps are repeated about 5-7 times (as necessary) until the supernatant is clear. Once we get the final pellet, we freeze them at -80C and then freeze dry them to remove all water contents. Therefore, agitation should not destroy the microspheres while in water IF the process is fairly quick. If they're dry, agitation does not destroys them.   
* **Q.** If the microspheres were introduced to a fluid, any properties that would affect the microspheres adversely? For instance, could water be a medium that could be used for transport or maybe a non-polar medium would be better? Follow-up question: is the small flask of microspheres we observed in the lab observation the typical amount that needs to be sorted? (sorry i think you probably answered this one before)   
* **A.** The microspheres are made out of polycaprolactone (PCL) which is a polymer that slowly degrades via hydrolysis. If the microspheres are in presence of water, the will start degrading slowly (however PCL is used for drug release due to it's slow degradation ;) ). So if you guys are thinking on suspending them in water to separate them by size, that's ok, just make sure that the process doesn't take too long and it can be performed right before the washing steps. I'm not sure if a non-polar medium would be better, because we'd have to clean them afterwards (which adds extra time) and it might degrade them. You'd have to do more research on this one. I think that leaving them in water will be the best option.   

* **A.** Usually we use about 640mg of PCL, so if our yield was 100% (in an ideal world) that's how much we'd have to filter. 

## Regarding the design  
* **Q.** Does starting volume matter? I.e. would you rather have a bigger flask (at what volume?) to filter the spheres or would it work better with small starting volumes? Your answer will help us determine the prototype

* **A.** I think having a large volume where all the microspheres can be filtered at once would be the most convenient (as far as it doesn't clog). Currently the device that we use only holds a couple of ml and this adds time and makes the process quite tedious. If we could filter 200ml that would be perfect.  ~50ml is still good. 

* **Q.** Is the initial amount that needs to be sorted relatively the same after the production process or does it vary?
* **A.** The final yield (once they're freeze dried) varies every time. However the initial PCL used is the same ~ 640mg.



## On the day of hackathon  
* Will the mentors be there to answer more questions?
* Will we be able to get mentorship on using machining or printing tools?  

# Questions about the hackathon   
* What do we do on the day of?
* Do we need to have a prototype? Final product? Or just a presentation of our ideas? 
* Can we propose several strategies? 

# Questions about Makerspace  
* Can we access the space/ start earlier?
